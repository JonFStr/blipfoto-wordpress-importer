# Blipfoto importer

A WordPress plugin to import journal entries and photos from a [Blipfoto](https://www.polaroidblipfoto.com) daily photo journal into a WordPress website.

## Important notes

This plugin was written extremely quickly in response to the possible (but as yet unconfirmed) demise of the Blipfoto website. It seems to work well but I cannot guarantee it is free of bugs.

Please back up your database before using it!

Please also note that I cannot see any way to retrieve your original high resolution images from Blipfoto, so this plugin will only retrieve the 'standard' size image. This is still good enough for display on most websites, but it is not your original full size image that you uploaded to Blipfoto.

If you are getting a 'syntax error' message, it means your hosting company is running an out-of-date version of PHP. You will need to ask them to upgrade to PHP5.4 or newer.
